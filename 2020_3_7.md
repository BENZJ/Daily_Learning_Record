## HLR: Generating Adversarial Examples by High-Level Representations
>Deep neural networks have enabled great advances in many artiﬁcial intelligence ﬁelds. However, these networks are susceptible to adversarial examples. Recently, many methods have been proposed to generate adversarial examples, but most of them only concentrate on the pixel-wise information, which limits the transferability of adversarial examples.
